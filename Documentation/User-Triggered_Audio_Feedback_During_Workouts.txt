Error Handling Flows:

Primary Flow:
User starts a workout session within the app.
After completing a set, the user interacts with the app to indicate that the set is finished.
A timer for the rest period starts in the app.
When the rest period ends, the system provides an audio cue to alert the user that it's time to start the next set.
Exception Flows: If the app fails to provide an audio cue, an error message is displayed.
Postconditions: The user receives audio cues at the end of each rest period, helping them to accurately time their sets.

Audio Cues for Timed Rest: As a user, I want the app to give me an audio cue when my rest period has ended, allowing me to focus on my workout without constantly checking the timer.
