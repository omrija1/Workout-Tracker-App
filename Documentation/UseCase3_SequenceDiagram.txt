Sequence Diagram for Use Case 3: Advanced Performance and Weight Tracking

Actors: User, System, Database

1. User -> System: OpenPerformanceTracking()
   Note: User navigates to the performance tracking section.

2. System -> Database: FetchUserData()
   Note: System fetches the necessary user data for performance metrics.
   
3. Database -> System: ReturnUserData()
   Note: Database returns the requested user data.

Condition: If Database returns an error, go to step 3a. Otherwise, proceed to step 4.

3a. Database -> System: ReturnError()
    System -> User: DisplayError()
    Note: An error message is shown, and the user can retry or exit.
    Return to step 2.

4. System -> User: DisplayPerformanceMetrics()
   Note: System processes the user data and displays performance metrics.

5. User -> System: UpdateWeight(new_weight)
   Note: User decides to update their weight.

6. System -> Database: UpdateWeightInDB(new_weight)
   Note: System sends the updated weight to the database.

Condition: If Database returns an error, go to step 6a. Otherwise, proceed to step 7.

6a. Database -> System: ReturnUpdateError()
    System -> User: DisplayUpdateError()
    Note: An error message is shown, and the user can retry or exit.
    Return to step 5.

7. Database -> System: ConfirmUpdate()
   Note: Database confirms that the weight was successfully updated.

8. System -> User: DisplayConfirmation()
   Note: User is notified that their weight was updated successfully.

9. System -> Database: RecalculatePerformanceMetrics()
   Note: System asks the database to recalculate performance metrics based on the new weight.

10. Database -> System: ReturnUpdatedMetrics()
    Note: Database returns the recalculated performance metrics.

11. System -> User: DisplayUpdatedMetrics()
    Note: System displays the updated performance metrics to the user.

Postconditions: User's weight is updated, and performance metrics are recalculated and displayed.
