Postconditions: 
    - If 'Edit', the user is redirected to the workout editing screen.
    - If 'Delete', the workout is deleted from the dashboard but remains in the performance history chart.

note: if user delete workout or edit workout that he haven't submitted for completetion, we preserve Performance History
if user delete workout that he have submitted for completetion, we preserve Performance History
if user edit workout that he have subbmited for completetion, we preserve and recalculate Performance History
completetion = when user does his workout session and click, done i did it. so it gets sent to our database for calculations
simply creating workouts doesnt reflect or affect the performance history, only subbmited ones
